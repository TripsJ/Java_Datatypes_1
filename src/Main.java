/*Create a small application that will assign and print out an example of all the primitive data types in Java. hint: None of these datatypes have a capital letter.

        Extra
        byte, short, int, long, char, float, double, and boolean.


        How come you can just print all of these datatypes?
        Why are those called primitive data types?
        Why can't you assign a double to an integer?
        But why can you assign an integer to a char?
        Why can't you assign a long to a int?*/
